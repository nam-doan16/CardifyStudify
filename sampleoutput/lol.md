# Java Arrays
- An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type, referred to
  by a common name.
- In Java, arrays are objects, and must be created dynamically (at runtime).

## Declaring an Array
- General Form: type[] arrayName;
- ex: int[] myData;

- The above only creates a reference to an array object, but no array has
  actually been created yet.

## Creating an Array (Instantiation)
- General form:  arrayName = new type[numberOfElements];
- ex: myData = new int[100];

- Data types of the reference and array need to match.
- numberOfElements must be a positive Integer.
- Gotcha: Array size is not
  modifiable once instantiated.

# Vectors
- Vectors act like resizable arrays.

## Declaring a vector
- General Form: Vector<type> v = new Vector();
- Example: Vector<Integer> v = new Vector();

- type needs to be a valid reference type

## Adding an element to a vector
- v.add(object of type);

- Reminder - go back and review clearing a vector!

# Hello
- hello
